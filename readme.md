Build a number guessing game in Python, where the computer chooses a random number and the user has 5 tries to guess the number.

Your program should include:

A header comment at the top of the file (including name, date, and brief description of code).  (3 points)
Comments describing what your code is doing.  (2 points)
A loop that gives a user 5 tries to guess a random number between 1 and 10, exiting if they guess it correct. (12 points)
Clear print() statements throughout (easy enough for a random person to play). (2 points)
Other helpful notes:

Choose a random number between 1 and 10.
Prompt the user for their guess and tell them how many tries they have left after each guess.
If the guess is wrong, tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.
If the user does not guess correctly within 5 tries, print out the correct number.
Exit the loop if the user guesses correctly.
